# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the issue where the "Simulados" menu is not appearing in the admin panel at http://localhost:8000/admin. The menu should be visible and functional, allowing administrators to access the simulados management features that are already implemented in the system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see the Simulados menu in the admin panel, so that I can access and manage simulados in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator logs into the admin panel THEN the system SHALL display the Simulados menu item in the navigation sidebar.
2. WHEN an administrator clicks on the Simulados menu item THEN the system SHALL expand the menu to show available options (Listar Simulados, Criar Simulado).
3. WHEN the administrator is on any simulados-related page THEN the system SHALL highlight the Simulados menu item to indicate the current section.
4. IF the administrator has appropriate permissions THEN the system SHALL allow access to all simulados management features through this menu.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want the Simulados menu to be properly integrated with the existing admin layout, so that it maintains a consistent look and feel with the rest of the admin interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Simulados menu is displayed THEN the system SHALL use the same styling and behavior as other menu items in the admin panel.
2. WHEN the admin panel is viewed in dark mode THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate dark mode styling to the Simulados menu.
3. WHEN the admin panel is viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL ensure the Simulados menu is responsive and accessible.
